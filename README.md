## 🚀 About the Startup
**Mechanic Setu** is a startup founded and launched by a **19-year-old college student** currently pursuing a **BCA at Shreyarth University**, in partnership with **Dhruv Panchal**. 

We are on a mission to bridge the gap between stranded vehicle owners and professional mechanics through a real-time digital marketplace.

### 📍 Local Presence (Ahmedabad)
We are currently live and serving users in the following areas of **Ahmedabad**:
* Paldi | Chandranagar | Anjali | Vasna 
* Jivraj Park | Nehrunagar | Manekbag | Ambavadi

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Request Assistance:** Users select their vehicle issue (e.g., puncture) and share their location via the app.
2. **Matching:** Our system identifies the nearest verified "Setu Partner" mechanics.
3. **Real-time Tracking:** Once a mechanic accepts, users can track their arrival in real-time.
4. **Instant Repair:** The mechanic arrives at the user's location to fix the issue on the spot.

## 🌟 How It Helps
* **For Vehicle Owners:** Eliminates the stress of searching for a garage while stranded. It provides transparent pricing and fast response times.
* **For Mechanics:** Acts as a powerful customer acquisition channel, helping local shops grow their business digitally.
* **Safety & Trust:** All partners are verified, ensuring a secure experience for the user.

## 🔌 Local Development (API routing)
In development, this project uses Vite’s proxy to route requests to different backends:
- **Auth only** (`/api/core/*`, `/api/users/*`) → `https://mechanic-setu-backend.vercel.app`
- **Everything else** (`/api/*`) → `https://mechanic-setu-backend.vercel.app`
- **WebSocket** (`/ws/*`) → `wss://mechanic-setu-int0.onrender.com`

WebSocket hosts can be overridden with:
- `VITE_WS_HTTP_BASE` (default `https://mechanic-setu-int0.onrender.com`)
- `VITE_WS_BASE` (default `wss://mechanic-setu-int0.onrender.com`)
